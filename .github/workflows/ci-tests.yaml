# FILE: .github/workflows/ci-tests.yml
#
# PURPOSE: Automates running tests and checking code coverage on the main branch and pull requests.
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Runs pytest and generates a coverage report.
# Enforces a coverage threshold (default: 70%).
# Installs dependencies using Poetry before running tests.
#
# DISCLAIMER: Do not edit this file unless explicitly permitted.
# This document serves as the single source of truth for development guidelines.
# Unauthorized changes can result in inconsistencies across repositories and disrupt the workflow.
# If you believe updates are necessary, consult the infrastructure team for review and approval.
